The Hijri calendar (sometimes referred to as the Islamic calendar) is a lunar calendar used in Islamic countries or by muslim communities in non-Islamic countries.

The calendar type system was introduced in 2.6, so this will not work in any Moodle versions earlier than this.

Thanks to Mark Nelson for his contributions to this plugin.

To install this calendar type do either of the folllowing steps.

========================== Git (recommended) ==========================

Once you have git installed, simply visit the calendar/type folder in your Moodle directory and clone https://github.com/rezaies/moodle-calendartype_hijri.git, remember to rename the folder to hijri if you do not specify this in the clone command.

Eg. Linux command line would be as follow -

git clone https://github.com/rezaies/moodle-calendartype_hijri.git hijri

Use git pull to update this repository periodically to ensure you have the latest version.

============================= Download ================================

Download and extract the zip, rename the folder to hijri and place this folder in the calendar/type folder in your Moodle directory.
